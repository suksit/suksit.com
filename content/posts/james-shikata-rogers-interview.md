Yesterday I watched a video that John Hammond interviews James "Shikata" Rogers. It was very informative and inspiring.

They mainly discussed about internal pentesting to verify network and Active Directory security -- misconfigurations, default weaknesses, and some great tradecrafts and techniques.

They also touched on the topic of OT cybersecurity, and emphasized on network segmentation.

Highly recommended!
