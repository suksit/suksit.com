ระหว่างที่[เตรียมตัวเพื่อสอบ CISSP](/posts/cissp-exam-preparation-review) ได้เห็นคำแนะนำหลายๆ อย่างน่าสนใจ เลยเอามารวบรวมไว้ เผื่อใครจะเอาคำแนะนำที่เข้ากับตัวเองไปปรับใช้ได้ครับ 🙂

### 1.
> For 95% of questions you will know whether you know it or not. If you do answer it and move on. If you do not, read it once more, take your best guess and move on.
>
> The remaining 5% will be ones you feel like you should know but also feel like something is off, or you are forgetting a small part. On these questions, read the question a few times, eliminate the answers you know are wrong and you will either be able to determine the answer, or you can't. Either way pick the one that feels right and move on.
>
> Finally, you can't go over or re answer questions, so once you answered and click next, forget about the previous question. Waste no time re thinking old questions you can't change.

### 2.
> Be careful of words like All, Always, Never, and so forth as most things are not absolute and often if you see an absolute it can be a good way to dismiss an answer. But that doesn't mean it automatically makes it wrong.

### 3.
> The single biggest thing that led to my success was framing everything from chapter one to the last of the OSG in terms of risk avoidance, risk transference, risk mitigation, or risk acceptance.
>
> I see a lot of people getting hung up on the technical and small small details. This is undoubtedly important but if you think about the test, specifically the CISSP in terms of risk and can relate almost everything to this in a concise manner you are going to pass this thing. 

### 4. ส่วนตัวผมใช้อันนี้บ่อยที่สุด
> Some practice questions are bad question. You'll know it when you see it so don't pay much attention to it.

### 5.
> You need to identify ONE primary resource - video series, book, boot camp - and build upon it.
>
> For me, reading the OSG cover-to-cover was my foundation; for somebody else, watching Adam's paid video course was their foundation. 
>
> Regardless, you need to pick ONE foundational resource and let it act like the hub of a wheel.

### 6.
> You are the middleman. You are not the boss but you aren't the minion doing the server update.
>
> But you are the person who calls someone in case there is an issue. So you have to be knowledgeable enough to understand and escalate.

### 7.
> Think of yourself as a security advisor on a Zoom call and they are asking you 125-175 questions of what to do.

### 8.
> Remember people, process, technology. In that order.

### 9.
> Don't use practice test score to gauge your readiness, instead use it to find your weak areas.
